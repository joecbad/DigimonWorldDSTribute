<p><i>Digimon World DS is a video game within the Digimon franchise for the Nintendo DS!</i></p>
<br/>

<p>	Digimon Word DS is one of my favorite video games. My earliest encounter with Digimon was when I was at a used bookstore with my Dad when I was very young, and I saw a book with Digimon on it. I just thought the pictures and the descriptions looked really cool, especially a walrus-like Digimon Ikkakumon and his digivolution Zudomon. Soon after that my Dad also got me a copy of Digimon World DS, which I played but I didn't get very far. I don't exactly remember but I think I went down a wrong way in the level, and when I hit a dead end I kept trying to find a different way to go but I couldn't find any other way. I kept trying until I eventually gave up. That was until many years ago when I decided to try at the game again, and I was so engrossed by it and it officially became one of my favorite games of all time. </p>
